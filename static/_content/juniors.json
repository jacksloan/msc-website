You must have a MN State Park sticker if you drive.  We will meet in the Parking lot and go skate roller skiing for about 1.5 hours on the bike path.   Camp set up is at 4:00 PM, we will be at the group camp.   We will allow 12-14 athletes at this camp.  It will be camping so I will send out a what to bring list. \n\nThe training will be technique and long slow stuff as we are going to run and roller ski for about 10-14 hours during the camp.   The weather is usually very good that time of the year with highs in 70's and lows in the 50's.   It gets dark a little early though, around 8:00 PM.   We will be carpooling with equipment and people but most of the camp will be running and roller skiing right from the campsite.  Coaching, food, video all included.  Sign-up will be linked in about May 22nd.  \n\nMEA- this camp would be in Hayward Thursday, October 21-Sunday the 24th.  This camp would be limited to the number of people too.  Lots of roller skiing, some running, and staying at one or two cabins.   \n\nWest Yellowstone Camp\n\nDriver departure date Friday, November 19th and back home by Saturday evening the 27th.  The drive would be 5-6 hours Friday and the rest on Saturday, coming and going.  Flying would be Saturday the 20th and flying back home on Saturday the 27th.  The cost would be about $900 to drive with people being responsible for the food on the way out and back but once we are there food, lodging, a trail pass is all covered.  There is also a nice Wolf and bear exhibit too.  Flying- we will have a coach coordinating that too.  Flying is a bit more expensive.  This camp would have sign-ups beginning on September 1st.   \n\nSenior Nationals\n\nWe will need to get reservations this May and will be sending out details soon.   It is a great chance for people to race against the best in the nation.  It is a great chance for people to see what colleges they might want to go to.   We will probably will only have a few U16's but more U18's and U20's.   More details in late May.",
